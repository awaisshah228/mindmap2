# BPMN Shape Library (Draw.io)

Business process modeling. Use swimlanes for lanes, rectangles for tasks, diamonds for gateways.

## Layout
- **Swimlanes**: Horizontal lanes (one per role/actor). Use type "swimlane" or grouped rectangles.
- **Tasks**: rectangle, 140×50, backgroundColor #e7f5ff
- **Events**: ellipse for start/end
- **Gateways**: diamond for XOR/AND decisions

## Flow
- Left-to-right within swimlanes
- Spacing: 180px horizontal, 140px vertical between shapes. No overlap.
- Cross-lane arrows for handoffs
- Gateway edges: label "yes/no" or condition
